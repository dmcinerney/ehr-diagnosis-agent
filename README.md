# EHR Diagnosis Agent

This repository can be used for training and testing models for risk prediction with electronic health records by building on top of the ehr-diagnosis-env environment:

https://github.com/dmcinerney/ehr-diagnosis-env

It contains code for preprocessing MIMIC-III (https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) and can be easily extended to other EHR sources with a minimal amount of preprocessing code.

It can also be visualized using the interface here:

Paper and Detailed usage instructions coming soon.
